# OpenVINO Plugin for Unity

![openvino-plugin-demo](openvino-plugin_in-editor.gif)



This is an updated version of my initial project that enables the plugin to be used in the Unity Editor and removes the need to manually move files when building the project.

**Important**: The `OpenVINO_Plugin` Visual Studio project now uses Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit `2021.4.2`.

**Note:** Only GPU inference is enabled when using the Barracuda engine, due to performance constraints.
